Module "InfraredTOF_I2C" (component I2C_LDD)
   - InfraredTOF_I2C_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors 
                and sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the 
                Enable() method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before 
                the second call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - InfraredTOF_I2C_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, 
                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - InfraredTOF_I2C_MasterSendBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The slave address 
                must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, "Target 
                slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. 
                The state of transmission is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete or OnError). Data to be sent 
                are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - InfraredTOF_I2C_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and then receives the block of characters from the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - InfraredTOF_I2C_SelectSlaveDevice -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave, 10-bit address or 
                general call value. Any send or receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is 
                selected by this method. This method is available for the MASTER mode.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.
   - WAIT1_Init -Driver initialization routine.
   - WAIT1_DeInit -Driver de-initialization routine

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)

Module "LED_Onboard_Green" (component LED)
   - LED_Onboard_Green_On -This turns the LED on.

   - LED_Onboard_Green_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED_Onboard_Green_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For 
                On/off pins, values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LED_Onboard_Green_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED_Onboard_Green_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "GI2C1"     (component GenericI2C)
